The original data is the result of experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years(ID from 1 to 30).
Each person performed six activities(Walking,Walking_upstairs,Walking_downstairs,Sitting,Standing,Sitting) wearing a smartphone on the waist.
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, researchers captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The features of the dataset are recorded in the "features.txt" of the zip file downloaded.

R script is used to handle the dataset.
