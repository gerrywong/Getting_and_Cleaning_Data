The script contains a file called "run_analysis.R" and a codebook called "CodeBook.md".

The goal of the script is to tidy the data downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

First, download the zip file to the working directory of R/RStudio.

Second, unzip the file to the working directory.

Third, run the "run_analysis.R" script.

There will be a txt file called "Tidy_data.txt" which is the tidy data after calculated.
