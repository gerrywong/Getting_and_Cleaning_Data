The repo contains a file called "getdata.R", a file called "run_analysis.R" and a codebook called "CodeBook.md".

The goal of the script "getdata.R" is to  download data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and then unzip it to a "data" folder.

Then run the "run_analysis.R" script to tidy the data.

There will be a txt file called "Tidy_data.txt" which is the tidy data after calculated.
